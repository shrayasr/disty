# disty
> The distribution manager from hell

I got really bored of redownloading things like bootstrap, w2ui, jquery, etc in all my projects and i *dont* want to use things like bower for this because I don't want to install nodejs for just this. 

Ergo, a shell script. BOOM.

# To use

## Adding a distribution archive

distyadd </path/to/archive> <distribution_name>

## Copying an existing distribution to current dir

disty <distribution_name>
